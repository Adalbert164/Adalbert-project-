# Smart Traffic Lights â€“ Adalbert Project
*Final project for the Building AI course*

## Summary
Smart Traffic Lights uses AI to optimize traffic light timings in cities based on real-time traffic conditions. It aims to reduce congestion, shorten commute times, and improve road safety by adapting signals dynamically.  
**Building AI course project**

## Background
Traffic congestion in urban areas leads to:
- Long travel times
- Increased fuel consumption
- Higher carbon emissions
- Stress for drivers and pedestrians

This problem is **frequent and global**, especially during rush hours. My personal motivation is seeing the daily traffic jams in my city and wanting to design a solution that makes commuting faster, safer, and more eco-friendly.

---

## How is it used?
- **Setup**: Sensors and cameras installed at intersections collect traffic flow data.
- **Processing**: AI analyzes live traffic density, predicts congestion, and adjusts green/red light durations in real-time.
- **Users**: City traffic authorities, commuters, logistics companies, and public transport managers.
- **Environment**: Works in both small and large cities, especially during peak hours.

## Data sources and AI methods
- **Data sources**:
  - Real-time traffic cameras
  - IoT sensors at intersections
  - GPS data from navigation apps (e.g., Google Maps API, OpenStreetMap)
- **AI methods**:
  - Reinforcement Learning for traffic signal optimization
  - Computer Vision for vehicle counting
  - Time Series Prediction for congestion patterns

---

## Challenges
- Requires hardware installation and maintenance.
- Privacy concerns with video data collection.
- Dependent on internet connectivity and sensor reliability.

---

## What next?
- Build a simulation using **SUMO** (Simulation of Urban Mobility) to test models before deployment.
- Integrate with city transport APIs.
- Partner with local governments for pilot testing.
